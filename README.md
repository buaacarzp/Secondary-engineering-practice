## This repository is the code of the Server . Using the HTTP communication to contact with the Client.

### Enviroment required:
1.Python 3.x
2.Win10 or linux which had been confired ok.
3.The module required are: flask, opencv-python,dlib,imutils,time,numpy
## How to run this project
### step1:
You should look the call.py and only have to change the name of "xxxxx.py", this file can transform the value to the cmd or shell, you also should notice the location of the "xxxxxx.py".  
### step2:
the caffe model had been packed ,so you only need to load the model to start your detection.
### step3:
the  module of the tracking  will need the dlib , if your system is windows, please pip the file we had uploaded . 

## My code  have little annotation, please contract with me if you have trouble to look this project.
 The very big problem is that you haven't a C# client , But you don't need to feel confused, you can create a client by python to visit your own computer. The code I had been writted in the python_client.py, you only need to change the address of the server in the python_client.py and the Python_service_backup1.py .
# Which we have to do in the next four days?
## 1. 
the C# should give a text box to input the address of the server, not to write in the code .
## 2. 
the python should give the results of the obeject-realy-tracking to the C#, and the C# should change the format of the base64 to the fram of the video.
